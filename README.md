# Algo word problems!

- This is a collection of word problems for folks to work on when they get done early in my class. 

- Each folder will have 2 files, an index and a test file. 

- After you clone this repo, run ```npm i``` to install Jest, which is our test running library. I have written tests for you. To run a test for a specific file, you would run ```npm run test [nameOfFile.test.js]```.

- The directions are in each file on what the requirements are to solve the algorithm. See me for the solution once you are done!
